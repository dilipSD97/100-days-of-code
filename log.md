### Bootstrap -> basics - components - buttons - container

**Today's Progress**: Learnt basics of Bootstrap, semantic sturcture of bootstrap components, buttons & containers

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is just CSS that bootstrap team wrote. It would save a lot of time because of the responsive nature of all the bootstrap components. Insted of styling a button from scratch we can just import the button from bootstrap. The way that bootstrap split-up components based on size by defining them as sm, md, lg etc., it very useful. Not to worry that all websites will look same if everyone uses bootstrap. we can completely customize any aspect of a bootstrap component to suit our needs.
