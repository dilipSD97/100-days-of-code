# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 28, 2021

### JavaScript -> DOM - Events

**Today's Progress**: learned about DOM & events. Built a simple utility.

**Thoughts:** Being some that straight away jumped into angular without properly learning basic due to work demand, I have had many doubts.. so circling back to the fundamentals now. today I learned about events, event bubbling (have seen preventDefault, stopPropagation. but never knew what they were), event delegation.

## Day 1: March 29, 2021

### JavaScript -> CallStack - WebAPIs - Callback Hell

**Today's Progress**: learned about Callstack, WebAPIs & Callback Hell.

**Thoughts:** learned how JS Interpreter keeps track of function call and the place to return, given its single threaded nature. facinated by how webAPIs aid in parts where JS is not suitable. and learn about callback hell, and the introduction of Promises as a potential solution for this issue.

## Day 2: April 02, 2021

### JavaScript -> async/await - Promises

**Today's Progress**: learned about Promises and various way to deal with them.

**Thoughts:** learned why call backs are bad way to implement asynchronous operations, and how promises evolved over time from callback to using then() and catch() to async-await syntax. async await give an absolute sytactic sugar and also makes it easier to implement asynchronous features.

## Day 3: April 03, 2021

### JavaScript -> XHR - Fetch API - Axios

**Today's Progress**: learned about XHR, Fetch API & Axios, and how to make HTTP requests with them.

**Thoughts:** learned why using XHR is very counter productive and how Fetch API overcame its drawbacks. also learned Axios and how easy it makes to send HTTP request from client-side as well as in Node.

## Day 4: April 04, 2021

### JavaScript -> DOM, Events, Axios, Array functions

**Today's Progress**: created a simple application that calls the API provided by TVMaze with a search query string and displays the search result in response using bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** learned how simple Axios makes it to do HTTP request, refreshed on Bootstrap, Array functions, DOM manipulation and events.

## Day 5: May 02, 2021

### JavaScript -> Prototypes, Factory functions, Classes

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Prototypes, Factory functions vs Constructor functions vs Classes, OOP in JS.

**Thoughts:** Learned what those mysterios "\_\_proto\_\_" in every object in javascript. learnt how OOP is implemeted in JS. Why Constructor functions are better then Factory Functions and what advantage ES5 Classes offers over Constructor functions. Learned basic OOP concepts such as inheritence(super, extends) in JS.
