### JavaScript -> DOM - Events

**Today's Progress**: learnt about DOM & events. Built a simple utility.

**Thoughts:** Being some that straight away jumped into angular without properly learning basic due to work demand, I have had many doubts.. so circling back to the fundamentals now. today I learnt about events, event bubbling (have seen preventDefault, stopPropagation. but never knew what they were), event delegation.
